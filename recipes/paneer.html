        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>

            <li>1 pound paneer, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>

            <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
            
            <li>1 medium green bell pepper, chopped</li>

            <li>2 medium jalapeño peppers, chopped</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon ground cashews</li>
            
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic paste</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>

            <li>1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>

            <li>1 pint half-and-half</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pan-Fry the Paneer</strong>
                Melt the butter in a large skillet or deep pan over medium-high heat. 
                Add the paneer cubes and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they're lightly golden on all sides. 
                Remove the paneer from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables and Aromatics</strong>
                In the same pan, add the chopped onions, bell pepper, and jalapeños. 
                Cook for 5-7 minutes until the onions are soft and translucent. 
                Stir in the garlic paste, ginger paste, and ground cashews, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Add the Spices</strong>Add the cayenne pepper, cumin, coriander, and garam masala to the pan. 
                Stir constantly for about 30 seconds to toast the spices and release their flavors, being careful not to let them burn.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Create the Curry Sauce</strong>
                Pour in the tomato sauce and stir well to combine with the vegetables and spices. 
                Let it simmer for 3-4 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the half-and-half. 
                Add salt to taste and mix until the sauce is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Finish and Serve</strong>Return the paneer cubes to the pan, gently stirring them into the sauce. 
                Simmer for 3-5 minutes until the paneer is heated through and has absorbed some of the sauce. 
                Serve hot with naan bread or over basmati rice.</li>

        </ol>
