        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>Bring the romance of a Parisian brasserie to your table with this steak frites. 
            Juicy hanger steaks are draped in a silky sauce made with white wine, beef broth, and umami-rich anchovies, 
            finished with a generous pat of fresh herb butter that melts over each bite.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>

            <li>4 hanger steaks</li>

            <li>4 tablespoons minced shallot</li>

            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>

            <li>½ cup beef broth</li>

            <li>4 anchovy fillets, chopped, or more to taste</li>

            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh chervil</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme</li>
            
        </ul>
       
       
       
       
     <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sear the Steaks:</strong>
                Pat the hanger steaks dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper. 
                Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
                Add the steaks and sear for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or adjust to your preferred doneness. 
                Transfer the steaks to a plate, tent loosely with foil, and let rest while you make the sauce.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Build the Pan Sauce:</strong>
                In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium and add the minced shallots. 
                Cook for 1-2 minutes until softened, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. 
                Pour in the white wine and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes until reduced by half. 
                Add the beef broth and chopped anchovies, stirring until the anchovies dissolve into the sauce.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Finish with Herb Butter:</strong>
                Remove the pan from heat and stir in the butter, one tablespoon at a time, swirling the pan until it melts into a silky sauce. 
                Add the minced parsley, chervil, and thyme, stirring to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Plate and Serve:</strong>
                Place each steak on a warm plate and spoon the herb butter sauce generously over the top. 
                Serve immediately with crispy French fries (frites) and a simple green salad for an authentic Parisian bistro experience.</li>
        </ol>
