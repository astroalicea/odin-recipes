        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>

            <li>4 tablespoons sesame oil</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>

            <li>tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>

            <li>1 cup sesame seeds</li>

            <li>(6 ounce) tuna steaks</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

            <li>wasabi paste</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Make the Marinade:</strong>
                Whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, mirin, honey, and rice wine vinegar in a medium bowl until the honey is fully dissolved and the mixture is well combined.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Tuna:</strong>
                Place the tuna steaks in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them, turning to coat all sides. Let them marinate for 15-20 minutes at room temperature, flipping once halfway through.</li>   
            <br>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Sesame Coating:</strong>
                Spread the sesame seeds in a shallow plate or dish. Remove the tuna steaks from the marinade, letting any excess drip off (reserve the marinade if desired for serving).</li> 
            <br>
            <li><strong>Coat the Tuna:</strong>
                Press each tuna steak firmly into the sesame seeds on both sides, ensuring an even, generous coating that adheres well to the fish.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong>
                Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or cast-iron pan over high heat until it's very hot and almost smoking. This ensures a proper sear.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sear the Tuna:</strong>
                Carefully place the sesame-crusted tuna steaks in the hot pan. Sear for 1-2 minutes per side for rare, or slightly longer if you prefer medium-rare. The tuna should be golden brown on the outside and still pink in the center.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Slice and Serve:</strong>
                Remove the tuna from heat and let it rest for 1 minute. Slice each steak against the grain into ½-inch thick pieces. Serve immediately with wasabi paste on the side.</li>    
        </ol>
